// illustration of exception-handling
// The example is stimulated by the novel "Anna of the Five Towns"
// by Arnold Bennett. Bennett, though one of England's greatest
// writers of the early 20th century, was wrong about the number
// of towns that constituted his home city (Stoke-on-Trent). The
// author of the code spent much of his early life in the one that
// was missed out, hence this code....

// The example is rather artificial, but illustrates most aspects of
// exception-handling. One of two possible exceptions is thrown in 
// method1. The exceptions are caught non-locally (here, in the main
// method, and are handled separately dependent on which exception
// was thrown.
